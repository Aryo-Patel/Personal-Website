            <p class = "content-body">Performed reserach under members at IBM's TJ Watson Research Center. The aim of the reserach to improve the detection of lung adenocarcinomas by fitting machine learning models to RNA sequencing data gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). I used synthetic minorty oversampling technique to correct there being an overwhelming number of cancerous samples in the dataset. Afterwads, I used principal component analysis to drastically reduce the dimensionality of the data. Finally, I used transcriptional profiling to detect trends in the RNA sequences.</p>
